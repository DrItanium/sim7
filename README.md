# simz - an i960 simulator targeting desktops written in zig


Zig is a very rad new programming language which contains a bunch of cool
features that I think make it a wonderful target for emulation. 

Specifically, the ability to directly model fields without truncation and the
mechanism that replaces bitfields. It also eliminates a bunch of extra
scaffolding that I had to do for sim5.
